# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering - Phase 2

This repository contains the code and documentation for the second phase of data preprocessing and feature engineering. The main objectives of this phase are to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, create interaction features, add polynomial features, perform binning, and scale/normalize the data.

## Usage
```bash
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run the preprocessing script.
Data Preprocessing Steps
1. Handling Missing Values
Impute missing values using strategies such as mean, median, and mode imputation.

2. Encoding Categorical Variables
Convert categorical variables to numeric using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.

3. Creating Interaction Features
Create interaction terms between features to capture the combined effects of pairs of features.

4. Adding Polynomial Features
Add polynomial terms of numeric features to capture non-linear relationships.

5. Binning
Discretize continuous variables into bins to convert numerical features into categorical ones.

6. Scaling/Normalization
Apply scaling techniques like Min-Max Scaling and Standard Scaling to normalize the data.

7. Log Transformation
Apply log transformation to reduce skewness of distributions.

8. Geographical Features
If the dataset includes geographical information, create distance-based features or cluster-based features.

Visualization
Visualize the data to understand its structure and the effects of preprocessing steps.

Saving the Processed Data
Save the processed data to a CSV file for further analysis or model training.
